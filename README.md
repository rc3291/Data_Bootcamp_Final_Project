Project Description
Our project seeks to examine a few factors that are priced into betting odds for betting agencies for soccer. We begin by taking a look at the existence of home team advantages and dig deeper to see if this advantage exists across all leagues. We find that betting agencies price home team advantages into their betting odds. We Then look to draw conclusions based on individual players, comparing them to top players, and seeing the relationship between this "spread" and betting odds. We come to the conclusion that more data will be necessary to control for ommitted variables to verify a relationship.
